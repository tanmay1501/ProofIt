## Overview

Guard AI is an application designed to enhance safety by using machine learning to identify objects that may pose hazards in various environments. The app aims to provide users with real-time information about potential dangers and suggestions on how to proof or secure these objects to prevent accidents.

## Features

### Object Identification

Guard AI utilizes a machine learning model to accurately identify objects within its scope. The model has been trained on a diverse dataset to recognize common household, workplace, and outdoor items.

### Hazard Assessment

Once an object is identified, the app assesses its potential hazard level based on various factors such as size, location, and context. The hazard assessment is designed to prioritize objects that may pose an immediate threat to safety.

### Proofing Recommendations

Guard AI not only identifies hazards but also provides users with practical recommendations on how to proof or secure the identified objects. This may include suggestions for proper storage, installation of safety devices, or relocation of items to safer locations.
